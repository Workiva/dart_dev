# By default, when an analysis context is established, it will look for
# configuration in an analysis_options.yaml file, starting in the current
# directory and working up through parent directories until it finds one.

# The analysis_options.yaml at the root of this project excludes the
# test_fixtures/ directory because it intentionally contains code that would
# otherwise get flagged by the analyzer as lints/warnings.

# However, if the test_fixtures/ directory is excluded when trying to use the
# analysis APIs on code in that directory (which is what our tests do), they
# will fail.

# This file works around that problem because the analysis context will use this
# (empty) configuration instead, which does not exclude the test fixtures.
